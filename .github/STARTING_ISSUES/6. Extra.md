## Extra Credit

**\[EXTRA\]** For some fun with the timer peripheral, implement a
    program that utilizes the timer to produce a “heartbeat” effect,
    that is, the brightness of the LED slowly increases until it reaches
    maximum, then slowly decreases until it reaches minimum value, and
    this cycle repeats indefinitely. Save this as the file `pwm_beat.c`
    in your repository, for extra credit.
