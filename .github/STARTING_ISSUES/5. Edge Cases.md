## Edge Cases

1.  The PWM control should also handle the edge cases of fully off (0% duty cycle) and fully on (100% duty cycle). As a first approach attempt to reach those by manipulating the counter for the  duty cycle.  What happens when you just disable the timers? Is the end state predictable? Report on your observations by adding a comment in this issue.
2.  Turning the signal fully on (or fully off) can be achieved by disabling one of the timers. Before trying it out, create a new comment in this issue in which you are reasoning what effects you expect when disabling one of the timers. Hint: each timer is responsible for one of the edge transitions. 
3.  Implement turning the signal fully on/fully off and integrate into your code. Add a new comment reflecting on about any potential differences to your reasoning before.
