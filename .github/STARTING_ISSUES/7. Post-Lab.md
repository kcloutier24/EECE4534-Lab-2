## Post-Lab

Update the earlier issues  about your findings, understandings, difficulties you
faced and the method for solving those difficulties and any other
observartions. Answere the questions directly in their resepective issues. 

In this issue answer the following question (and close issue when done):

1. See the individual assignment issues for explicit references what to include in the post-lab reflection.
2. This lab focused PWM generation through different methods in varying configurations.
It asked to collect a statistically relevant number of raw samples of the edge timings. 
To report on your analysis, create a directory: `report` with a README.md and the image files. 
3. In the lab report, create a common
graph with a  [Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function) 
for each of the tests (e.g. one each for #2, #3, #4). Pick either period or duty cycle for your analysis. 
Reason for your metric choice.
Assess the differences
between the generated signals using each method in a qualitative and quantitative way. 
4. Create one additional CDF to compare across the three methods of generating the PWM signal 
for one mesaurment condition. Pick the condition that highlights the differences across methods the best.
